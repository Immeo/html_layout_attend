# Doctor Exchange Platform - Project Description

This project is a 1200px-wide mockup of a physician exchange platform — a specialized digital marketplace connecting doctors with healthcare institutions and patients. Designed specifically for desktop screens, the layout prioritizes clarity, professional aesthetics, and intuitive navigation without adaptive responsiveness.

The platform enables doctors to create profiles, specify medical specialties, set availability, and connect directly with clinics or patients. Medical institutions can search, filter, and request specialists based on real-time data, streamlining staffing and telehealth solutions.

Key features of the design:

- Fixed 1200px layout optimized for standard desktop displays
- Clean, modern UI with role-oriented sections (doctors, clinics, administrators)
- Centralized dashboard concepts for quick access to key functions
- Search, filtering, and application tools tailored for medical staffing
- Secure profile verification and contact system

This static mockup serves as a visual prototype for a future scalable healthcare staffing platform, aiming to reduce administrative burden and improve access to qualified medical professionals.
